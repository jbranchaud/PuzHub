Solutions to a bunch of programming puzzles in a bunch of different languages!

A while back, I wrote a [blog post](http://joshbranchaud.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/my-somewhat-comprehensive-list-of-programming-problems/)
listing a bunch of programming puzzles and problem sets that I had aggregated
links to over time. I am interested in solving some of them myself, so I will
list them below and provide my solutions in the respective folders.

The only solutions that I have worked on posting so far are for Rosalind.
